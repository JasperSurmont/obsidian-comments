# Comments

This plugin adds basic comment functionality so you can collaborate easier accross teams.

## How it works
A new callout is defined
```
> [!comment] NAME | DATE
> COMMENT
```

If you click the ribbon to open the plugin, a view will open that will show all comments within the file (like in Word). This will show the name, date, and content of the comment (specified like in the callout above).

## Functionalities
- Command to quickly add a comment (`CTRL + P` --> `Comments: Add new comment`)
- Quickly remove comments by right clicking on the comment in the right view
- Quickly add subcomments by right clicking on the comment in the right view
- Quickly navigate to the place of the comment by left clicking the comment in the right view
- Comments are hidden in reading mode and when exporting it to other documents (e.g. PDF)

## Improvements

- [ ] Setting to choose hide behaviour
